# EcoAware
EcoAware AQI Mapper aims to combat global earth neutralization by combining data from IoT devices measuring pollution and weather APIs providing AQI levels in a very small area so the people collectively as a society could help make their area's AQI better. 

We will create a pictorial representation of AQI hotspots and provide recommendations for planting and measures based on regional data, helping communities make informed decisions to mitigate pollution.
This project encapsulates our idea of combining data sources to create actionable insights for addressing pollution and earth neutralization.
